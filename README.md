# MK3 - Ticker Technical Test Part 3

Disclaimer: the solutions for all Mk models consider robots are facing the positive side of Y axis:
```
y
^
|  ~ front side here ~
|     ___
|  .-/   \-.
|  ||_____||
|     ;;;   <--- now he has a rocket ðŸš€
|     
|   ~ back side here ~

--------------------------------------> x
```
And that's why you can't see his face here :)

## Setup

- Run `npm install`
- Runing the app `npm run dev`
- Running tests `npm run test` or `npm run watch-test`

## Description
Apparently there's a spray gun attachment coming for mk2. That'll be exciting. 

But not as exciting as the mk3 that's just landed on my desk. This puppy has ROCKETS.

So, the boys in the lab got a tad excited, granted, but they do have a purpose. Apparently we're sending a few of our robot buddies into Mars on a rocket! 

Management feel they are totally ready for this challenge and have obviously given us loads of time to test and make sure we're ready for the big launch on Tuesday.

Apparently on Mars it's rocky and there are canyons. Who knew. 

We've equipped the mk3 with a small fuel tank of propellant and rockets that can propel them forward really quite quickly. 

Good thing we made that change to point the little guy in a straight line all the time eh?

Anyway - it looks like we'll need to tweak your nav code one more time, but still supporting the mk1's doing car park cleaning (poor mk1s) and the mk2's on high rises with glass inspections.

Forward instructions can now have a number in front of them. 3F, 5F etc

Conveniently boosting into space over canyons forward 1 position burns 1 unit of fuel. 

The tank contains 30 units of fuel.

You can boost up to 5 units in one go before the thing overheats.

Until the sensor gear is finally ready, the guys are going to scout out the landscape from the satelites in orbit and continue to tell the robot where to go in advance.

Given a start (x,y), and a set of nav commands, now including forward boosts, lemme know where the robot will end up.

Oh, negative space is fine on Mars BTW. No building edges to fall off.

# MK2 - Ticker Technical Test Part 2

## Description
The mk2 has just arrived on my desk. Those robot nerds in white coats sure love cranking out these prototypes.

This robot has a few more bells and whistles, and this one is actually being prepped for a real life mission in the field!

So, management thought the robot scuttling from side to side was too "crab like" for a spider (sigh. marketing), so they 

want us to change the nav code to support the new rotation servo underneath the robot. 

A L or R command will now rotate the robot 90 degrees to the left or right, so now the F (Forwards) command will go in the direction the robot is facing. 

Management also thought the robot going backwards blindly was a bad idea after we lost that one into the fire pit, so now we need to turn it around and go in the direction we're facing if we need to head back the way we came.

The most exciting feature of the mk2 though is it's ability to GO UP WALLS :| It has sucker pads to stick to glass, and the first client for the mk2 wants to do glass inspections on high rise buildings.

So, same deal, we're going to provide the robot with a starting position on the glass, oriented from bottom, left (0,0) but we need to STOP the robot falling off the side of the building. 

So, the robot should ignore a command asking it to go into negative space. No more dead robots. RIP Kevin.

We still need to support the 500 mk1's we've got roaming around the place, so we'll need a strategy to cope with that somehow.

## Setup

- Run `npm install`
- Runing the app `npm run dev`
- Running tests `npm run test` or `npm run watch-test`

# MK1 - Ticker Technical Test Part 1

## Description
Welcome to Arachnid Robotics, delivering you Robot Spiders(TM) for all your robotic spider needs

I know you've only just landed here, but here's the Mk1 Prototype. Management are really excited about this one, and they've got lots of tricks up their sleeves for the Mk2 and the Mk3 which the guys in the big white coats in the science labs are busy working on as we speak. 

So, I understand you're the new software guy? Perfect. We need a first version of the navigation and locomotion code written. 

To start off with, we want to be able to remotely control the spiders movements with some simple text commands. It won't be interactive, we're only able to send a single message to tell the robot spider where to go at the minute.

The mk1 robot can move forwards, backwards and side to side. The control system will send the instructions in a single string, for example:

F = FORWARDS
B = BACKWARDS
L = LEFT
R = RIGHT

FRRRFFFFRFRFFFRFFLRLFFFFLRFF

This unit doesn't have any sensor tech yet (sigh. they're really cheaping out with this Mk1 ...), so at the moment the robot will just go where you tell it. 

The test chamber is set up with a flat surface and you need to tell the Robot where it is to begin with - (0,0) is at the bottom left of the grid (x,y) co-ordinates

I need the Robot Control Interface to accept two parameters - where it is (x,y) and the command sequence (FFFFFLLLLRRRFFFFBRRRBLLL). 

Given these two the robot should be able to report where it is at the end.

Get that done, and then maybe the mk2 will be ready!

Commit your code to a git repo and then we'll get it loaded up into the Mk1 Prototype in the test chamber and tell it where to go!

Here's some test data: 

0,0,FRFRFFFFFFFLLLLFFFFFRFFFFLFFLRRF = ?
3,6,FFFFFFFFRRRRRRRFFFFLLLBBRRRRRLLLLLLLLLRFFF = ?
0,7,RRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFFFLLLBBBBBRRRLLLLLFFLR =?

## Setup

- Run `npm install`
